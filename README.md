# MeNets

This repository contains the algorithms implemented in the CVPR 2019 paper: Mixed Effects Convolutional Neural Networks (MeNets) with Applications to Gaze Estimation.

Download Gaze Datasets from "https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-machine-learning/research/gaze-based-human-computer-interaction/appearance-based-gaze-estimation-in-the-wild/" and "http://www.hci.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/datasets/", then make them to .h5 format and gives their location to .prototxt file.
